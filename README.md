This project is to demonstrate a single function in javascript that concatenates all of the items from an array starting at a given index point. The index.html file initiates the project for a web browser, linking it to my JavaScript source file. The client.js file is the JavaScript file. Most of the action can be seen in the console on the web browser for this project.

I hope this is the kind of thing one wants to see in a README! Thank you for reading.
